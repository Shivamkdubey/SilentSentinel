# SilentSentinel
SilentSentinel is a tool that keeps your system active by automatically moving the mouse and clicking. It's designed to run silently after minimizing all open windows without causing any disruption to your workflow.

## Key Features:
- **Automatic Mouse Movements & Clicks**: Keeps your system active by simulating user interaction.
- **Minimizes All Windows**: Ensures that no accidental clicks cause issues by minimizing all open windows before performing automated actions.
- **Bypasses Activity Tracking Software**: Works seamlessly with activity tracking software like Teams and others.
- **Auto-Activation & De-Activation**:
  - Automatically detects when the user has resumed work and stops itself to avoid interference.
  - No need for manual start/stop â€” it intelligently manages itself based on user activity.
  
SilentSentinel ensures that your system stays active without manual intervention, so you don't have to worry about interruptions or inactivity detection by third-party software.
Can be used in server environments which needs to perform certain scheduled background actions, but needs to be kept awake until then.
